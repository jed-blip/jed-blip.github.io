            <strong>How technology allows us to communicate with unresponsive patients</strong>

                    Is it possible to communicate with coma patients?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whilst people within a coma cannot physically respond to any form of stimuli, this does not mean that their brains
                    cannot respond. They cannot speak or move any parts of their body, however scientists have found that for some
                    comatose patients, there is still full or partial consciousness present - enough for the brain to respond to things
                    such as speech, or simple questioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that in certain cases, it is actually possible to read brain scans and obtain feedback from a patient
                    that otherwise cannot exhibit any form of information, just by 'reading their minds'. This allows doctors to diagnose
                    certain things that they may have potentially missed, such as any physical pain that the patient may be experiencing
                    without having being able to say anything, and having some form of communication could potentially speed up recovery.

                    What are some ways to communicate?
                </h2>
                <img style="display: block; width: 30%; margin: auto;" alt="MRI Scan of a brain"

                <p>
                    At the moment, the easiest way to determine whether a coma patient is 'conscious' when they cannot respond with
                    physical indicators is to place them within a brain scan and ask them to do something such as "squeeze my hand".
                    If the motor cortex is activated, we know that the patient heard and understood and therefore is conscious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once consciousness has been determined, we can ask the patient questions (typically simple, yes/no ones) that
                    we know the answer to in order to see which parts of the brain send what signals based on the response, and
                    we feed that information into a machine learning model in order to predict the answers to questions we may not
                    know the answers to, such as "are you currently in pain?", and if the answer is yes, the questions could become
                    deeper in order to find out where the pain may be, and could potentially save the lives of patients in near-death
                    situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another application of this technology is the ability to study consciousness in a deeper form; studying patients
                    who are in a coma is a great way to study how consciousness may work, since there can be both cases where comatose
                    patients are either conscious or unconscious.
