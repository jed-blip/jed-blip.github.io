When cancer is detected early, treatment is more likely to be successful. But too often, cancers are diagnosed at a late stage when they’re much harder to treat. We’re generating, collecting and sharing more information than ever before, and this includes information that may be tied to our health. Security and privacy are a priority as technology and personal data are combined, but what if there was a way to link this information and improve cancer detection?</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><p class="alignCentre">Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have the potential to affect several facets of cancer therapy. These include drug discovery and development and how these drugs are clinically validated and ultimately administered at the point of care,
          among others. Currently, these processes are expensive and time-consuming. Therapies often result in variable treatment outcomes between patients. The convergence of AI and cancer therapy has resulted in multiple solutions to address
          these challenges. AI platforms ranging from machine learning to neural networks can accelerate drug discovery, harness biomarkers to accurately match patients to clinical trials, and truly personalize cancer therapy using only a patient's own
          data. These advances are indicators that practice-changing cancer therapy empowered by AI may be on the horizon.

        <td><p class="alignCentre">Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women, but early detection and treatment can considerably improve outcomes. As a consequence, many developed nations have implemented large-scale mammography screening programmes.
        Despite the widespread adoption of mammography, interpretation of these images remains challenging. The accuracy achieved by experts in cancer detection varies widely, and the performance of even the best clinicians leaves room for improvement. False positives can lead to patient anxiety, unnecessary follow-up and invasive diagnostic procedures. AI has the capabilities of vastly reducing the error-rate.</p>

It is poised to play an increasingly prominent role in medicine and healthcare because of advances in computing power, learning algorithms, and the availability of large datasets (big data) sourced from medical records and wearable health monitors. Learning algorithms are becoming more precise and accurate as they interact with training data, allowing newer insights into diagnostics, treatment options, and patient outcomes. The change AI has brought has been drastic, but so will be the future with it.r</p>
